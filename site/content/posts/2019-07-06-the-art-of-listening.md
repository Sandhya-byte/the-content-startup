  Hey guys how are you all? Hope everyone is good, happy and busy! As you all know, I am going through some pretty big changes in my life and I haven&#8217;t figured it out yet. So, that being said, I will be writing about
</p>

# _**The Art of Listening&nbsp;**_

    <strong>So when you are listening to somebody, completely, attentively, then you are listening not only to the words, but also to the feeling of what is being conveyed, to the whole of it, not part of it. </strong>

<p class="has-text-color has-black-color">
  We often confuse the word &#8220;Hearing&#8221; and &#8221; Listening&#8221; together. Trust me they have a massive difference. Hearing often happens when we have two-track mind, the person front of us talks while we hear. Yes, we do hear physically, mentally we are miles away.
</p>

<p class="has-text-color has-black-color">
  This happens to all of us. For example, we expertly tune out lectures, advice and any rants that makes us feel bored. All we give out is a pretty standard response of Hmm, You are right, Yeah, Yeah you are absolutely correct and so on.
</p>

<p class="has-text-color has-black-color">
  At this point of time, all we give out is pretty much a Hmm that has no rhyme or reason. Most of us put forth an convincing argument saying that No, I do listen to people and they talk 75% of the time and I give them a pretty good response.
</p>

<p class="has-text-color has-black-color">
  Till the recent times, I had the same notion as well. But so is not the case. It does not in anyway mean that you are a good listener or you are concentrated enough to understand the opposite person. In no way, you have mastered the art of listening either.
</p>

<p class="has-text-color has-drop-cap has-dark-red-color">
  So, how to find your way out this conundrum or pickle(term it whatever you like, it is a problem nonetheless)
</p>

I am going to list out a few tips that would help you learn the mastery of this skill.

## Eye contact: 

<p class="has-text-color has-black-color">
  Maintaining a steady eye contact is essential and to clarify, I am not talking about star gazing look of the ones in Love. Just a simple and meaningful look that gives the opposite person solace and an encouragement to carry on with their conversations.
</p>

## Never Interrupt:

<p class="has-text-color has-black-color">
  This is the second most important rule if you want to master this art. Always remember, when the opposite person is talking, the spotlight is on them, not you. Collect your thoughts while they talk and then express them after they finish. However, sometimes the opposite person might just want to vent, not hear opinions. So be careful of that as well.

## Active Listening:

<p class="has-text-color has-black-color">
  Active listening is a trick where you interrupt but not on the lines of your opinion, but by validating or by conforming their sayings. I know, I told you not to interrupt, but these questions are required for being an active listener. For example the questions of:
</p>

  * **Did you mean this?**
  * **Were you talking about this incident?**
  * **What I heard you say was ? and so on.**

<p class="has-text-color has-black-color">
  These questions will show as you person who is genuinely interested in their rant. At the same time, a trivial hmm, yes and ok will up the ante.
</p>

## Stop the inner wheels:

<p class="has-text-color has-black-color">
  It is a normal mechanism for us to contemplate and analyze each and every word uttered by the opposite person. But, if you want to be a good listener, stop thinking. We try to fill the gaps but we could or will lose valuable information once we start wandering. This wheel is also applicable to our judging quality.
</p>

<p class="has-text-color has-black-color">
  The mark of a good listener is to make themselves completely devoid of judging. No one will want to open up to a skeptical person. Be open-minded and mind those trigger words that will stop you from listening. Cast them aside as the person in front of you is more important than those words.
</p>

## Be on the lookout:

<p class="has-text-color has-black-color">
  Body gestures and postures also matter when you listen to others. See whether they are trusting enough to open up to you, are they squirming or displaying any other signs of discomfort. Also, create a suitable environment by trying your best to remove distractions like a buzzing phone, away from loud areas and such. These little gestures will showcase your care and consideration.
</p>

## Observe and learn:

<p class="has-text-color has-black-color">
  If you really want to master the art of listening,then start observing people around you. These will help you notice how people interact with each other, the gestures good, bad and the annoying. Make a checklist and see how many of them you match.
</p>

<p class="has-text-color has-drop-cap has-black-color">
  And if you are really brave enough, ask your friend to be honest about their opinion on how you interact with people.

<p class="has-text-color has-black-color">
  Learning and mastering the art of listening is a invaluable skill that will not only improve your communication, but helps you succeed in every aspect of life.
