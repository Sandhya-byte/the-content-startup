Hello everyone, hope all are in good health and mood. It has been a long time since I published a post and I have the oldest (sometimes very accurate)and the lamest excuse in the world.

_**SORRY COULDN&#8217;T FIND THE TIME, got caught up with my responsibilities.**_

Anyways, a friend of mine, a banker suggested that I can broach the subject of Artificial Intelligence. So here is me poking around and the article will have a follow-up because if I write an essay, nobody will be interested(We have had enough of them in our school and college).

So shall we?

**What is Artificial Intelligence (A.I)?**

Artificial intelligence is a term that depicts the task performed by a machine on par to a human. In other words, you don&#8217;t need to personally don the task at hand, the device will complete it for you.

Machines that are programmed to become A.I display the traits that are very unique to human beings like reasoning, planning, problem-solving, knowledge, perception, motion (robots), and manipulation and limited social intelligence and creativity.

Some of the famous examples of A.I in our daily life is Alexa, Siri and Google home devices. When shopping online, you would have noticed that you get  many automatic shopping recommendations (ding ding ding A.I at work) (FYI could be irritating too, as it won&#8217;t let you type what you want)

**Does AI have types?**

Of course, it does, come on we are seeing so many sci-fi movies where the coffee maker is wired to make coffee from the scratch that is low tech AI and the ship files when the crew is in a deep sleep, and that is really really hi-tech. However, let me put to you in a very formal term:

  * **Narrow Artificial Intelligence:**

Narrow AI is where the machines can do only particular kind of tasks like responding to simple customer queries(those who have used bank&#8217;s online help bot or online shopping sites bot would know the agony), applies in the medical field like MRI&#8217;s and other radiology scans, and many more.

  * **General Artificial Intelligence:**

This type of AI is yet to develop, and we have seen this tech in many movies like the Terminator, Wall-E, and many others that are still coming. Many scientists are of the opinion that the General AI will be fully functional by the year 2040 or 2050 (we will see about that won&#8217;t we)

As it goes, many countries are striving for a breakthrough in the field of Artificial Intelligence and have successfully integrated AI into their systems.

Hope you have a got a general idea of Artificial Intelligence with this article. Will follow up soon with a follow-up article in the banking and finance industry.

As usual, Namaste, Au Revoir, Sayonara and a simple Vanakkam to my readers out there where ever you are and whoever you are.
