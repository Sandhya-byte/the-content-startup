Hey guys, hope all are doing good and keeping yourselves engaged during this time of crisis😊😊. As you all know, I have been blogging about [smart contracts](https://www.thecontentstartup.com/how-do-smart-contracts-work/) and how they impact many verticals, especially real estate.

Moreover, real estate has not been a recipient of significant technological changes for decades. It is still following the same process, if not more, and takes a minimum a month to 45 days for a sale.

A few days back (weeks, I know, and I have entirely a valid reason for it😥😥), I got a question from Parvathy, one of my LinkedIn connections who raised a question of how smart contracts prevent fraud and illegal dealings.

I told her that I would write about it and totally put in the back burner due to the usual reasons of work, me being lazy and etc. 🙈🙈

She pinged me again yesterday, and now you see the result of **how smart contracts work** in real estate dealings.

## So, getting on to track,

For those who are new to this article, here is a small gist:

Smart contracts are the most popular and successful application of Blockchain. In fact, Ethereum, an open-source Blockchain platform, was built specifically for the creation of these smart contracts.

The “**Turing-Completeness**” feature of Ethereum lets you customize a contract suited explicitly for your transaction.

The usual contract process is to hire a lawyer, go to authorities for document verification and validation, and so on when it comes to buying and selling of property. But a smart contract renders all those actions obsolete by digitizing your assets.

## And here is how it works:

Say, for example, A wants to buy a beach house in Goa. The standard process would be that A has to rely on brokers, bankers, and Registrar officials to see the process through. Where the banks and government officials verify and validate the authenticity of the property papers, brokers charge a hefty sum as brokerage.

‘A’ must also combat and maneuver his way through people laying claim to their so-called property or involved in illegal money extortion.

So, in a nutshell, this whole process takes weeks sometimes months even🙄🙄, and if the property papers are incomplete, then you need to start the entire process again.

But in Smart Contracts, the system will root out any potential complexities like multiple ownership (except verified and registered owners)



## How **smart contracts work** in Blockchain?

In a Blockchain environment, A would buy and own the asset in a digital manner. This process is known as **Tokenization.**

The physical asset would be transferred to digital space and managed by people who have the legal right to own and also to inspect. Additionally,

1. There will be a depository to hold the asset.
2. An exchange for the transaction facilitation
3. A clearinghouse for quick processing of funds and 
4. A legal register that validates the sale and ownership

So, in real-time, what takes days to complete is finished within minutes and by a stretch of imagination, seconds.

If it is an illiquid asset like stocks or bonds, Tokenization allows multiple divisions to be held by separate owners.

So, you get security, speed, and ease of transfer from one single contract. Moreover, no one comes to know about the transaction except the parties involved.

Smart contracts reduce the risk of fraud and interference of third parties.
