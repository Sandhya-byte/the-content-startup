Today is the seventh year of World Radio Day, and many of us are well aware of this little box's role in our childhood. Our mother's way of telling time was through this wonder box. The signal of a show ending was our sign of getting ready to eat the breakfast or to leave for school. Back when Television sets were a luxury, the handy radio was the best bet for listening to the matches that take place between India and Pakistan. Every ball was cheered and followed with a reverence that rivaled our passion towards the deities. Even now when we go for long drives or to work, the radio is our co-traveler.

I still remember the time when my mother used to listen to the inspirational songs of the great poet Bharathi or to stories that teach the practicality of life. She passed on that knowledge and the love of radio to me. Even today the radio is a staple ingredient in my recipe of the morning routine. My mornings start by toggling between stations and setting my favorite channel.

The massive advantage of the radio is that it does not distract you from your work and if you really think about it, you will notice that it offers a serene and peaceful environment to do your daily chores or your work. There is an advantage of anonymity in the radio. Even today we can see the security personnel who take night shift duty have a radio by their side so that they do not fall asleep at work.

For the regional music lovers, the radio was the platform to stay updated with the new releases there were no websites to download or cds to listen to, only the radio. The golden songs of Asha Bhonsle, Lata Mangeshkar, Janaki Amma, or the magic tunes of R.D Burman, Ilayaraja and many more great artists and musical composers came alive through this box.

Even when it was night time or time to go to bed, our grandfather used to have the habit of listening to the day Taaza Khabar or the news of the day and then sleep. The radio still plays a versatile role in our lives to date. So, let us enjoy the radio and pass this beautiful artifact to our upcoming generations.

On that final note, as usual, Namaste, Au Revoir, Sayonara, and Vanakkam to my readers out there where ever you are and whoever you are.
