I hate my life. This is the most commonly used dialogue by us in daily life. Why we use this dialogue? A simple reason, we are plagued by our time constraints and schedule. We always try to be more productive rather than living in the present. I cannot accept that it is a luxury afforded by the elite. You, me and anyone can live in the present if we know what our present is?

As a work-at-home mom or stay-at-home mom or a working mom, we are always on the treadmill, continually running behind our kids, Husband, boss and many others(the list is quite long, believe me). The reason is simple enough, productivity. We try to complete everything. However, being productive also makes us lose the important moments that we can recollect and share with our next generation or that will make us smile or shed a tear or even ignite a loving thought.

Productivity doesn&#8217;t help you accomplish, it helps you to organize or de-clutter your life. That&#8217;s it. If you want to achieve them, you are in desperate need of a personal touch that can be given by you and only you to your life. As the great Roman Philosopher Seneca, once said:

**_As is a tale, so is life: not how long it is, but how good it is, is what matters._**

Stop running around in a routine, enjoy the smallest moments as they will bring the greatest joys in your life. Being organized is good, nevertheless, don&#8217;t be too organized as you will search for yourself at the end.

please let me know your thoughts.
