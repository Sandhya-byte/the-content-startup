**Finding ourselves, in a fork road is a very common phase in our life. We are forced to take decisions having other factors or persons in mind. Only some are afforded that luxury of choice. I, for one, had an early marriage at the age of 19, even though I was given the option of backing out, IÂ  went forward with it. My parents got divorced when I was 9 years and was raised by my mom single-handedly. She threw her inhibitions to the wind and raised two daughters all on her own without a single complaint. Raising two girls in a conservative society is no joke, but she did it with flair. My marriage was my first fork road where I stopped thinking about me for a second and thought of the woman who gave her all for me. So, taking a decision mindful of others does have its share of advantages. Yes one may argue it is my life why should I bother about others, we can not always base our decisions by thinking about the feelings of others, but including others in our fork roads can also give us a sense of security or a shoulder to lie on. Think about it and let me know your opinions. After all, a varied discussion opens a world of knowledge.**
