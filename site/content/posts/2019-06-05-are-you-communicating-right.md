Hello, everyone, I am back with a new post this week. Last week, I was discussing certain points related to the subject of productivity. I specifically asked you all to take a breather before putting everything on your head. Hope you all are following at least some of them.

Now we are on to the next topic of communication. I am pretty sure most of you would think this is the same old article of talking well, precise and clear. I assure you it is not, as communication is the one thing that defines us as humans. I am going to explore the finer points of communication or its subtlety that helps us in creating a unique identity.



Before we jump into the topic, I am going to tell you a story of my communication skill development:

I am quite willful and naughty (I still am, that story is for a different day) right from day one. I had and still have a habit of speaking quite fast and didn&#8217;t particularly bother if the opposite person could not understand me. I also had the nickname of Minnal(Lightning in Tamil) due to my fast and impetuous nature. As usual, I completed all milestones in life like studies, marriage, kids and so on.

But, I got stuck when I tried to communicate with my in-laws and other laws as well. It was like and still like(speed has gone down, mind you), repeating the same thing over and over in different tone variations. I couldn&#8217;t figure out the puzzle, as to why they aren&#8217;t talking to me.

That got me wondering? They never replied to me immediately, they will take at least a minute, look around in all directions and give me a totally unrelated answer to the question I never asked in the first place. This became a common occurrence.

One day I decided I had enough and demanded to know the truth of this injustice(just kidding). My Mother-in-law, (a smart woman) answered in me highway terms that I talk too fast and understanding me was an uphill task for them.

My ego was hurt! I was silently plotting ways to tell them that I talk good, their hearing capacity was the problem. But, alas my husband said the same thing as well(reaching out for tissues). Then, I decided as we say in Tamil Thattrom, Thukkurom, I swept into action.

Want to know what I did?

Well, you need to wait another week as you never break suspense all at the same time. There is no thrill!

See you guys next week! Till then, it is my signature goodbye

Namaste, Au Revoir, Sayonara and a simple Vanakkam to my readers out there where ever you are and whoever you are.
