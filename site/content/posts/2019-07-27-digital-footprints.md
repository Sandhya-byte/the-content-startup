<p class="has-drop-cap">
  Hello everyone, for the past couple of weeks, I have been writing about my corporate training topics in the shortest way possible. Yet, I felt something missing, and thanks to my friend, I was pulled back into the Fin tech sector . Fin tech has always been my avid interest .Like a child who always fancies the new toy, Fin Tech always gives me a chance to know and explore about new technologies and startups that are exploring this space.
</p>

Today I am exploring about the Internet of Things, more commonly known as Io T. Google does give some great and technical explanations and I am going to break it down for you.

**One quick news: The whole article, I will be using both terms Io T and Internet Of Things and it is Io T not the Io T**

Io T can best be explained in simple terms as tracking a physical object like car, bus or lorry through internet. The word &#8220;Thing&#8221; in Io T can mean a person or an automobile carrying an object with an IP address. It also has the ability to collect and transfer data without the need for an human interference.

Here is the list of spaces where Io T will make a noticeable impact:

  * Smart Living
  * Smart Industries
  * Smart Enterprises
  * Logistics
  * Banking and Finance sector and so on.

So, here is a short version of what is Io T. I will be writing about the workings of this tech in the coming blogs. 

Till then, it is time for my signature goodbye:

Namaste, Au Revoir, Sayonara&nbsp;and a simple Vanakkam to my readers out there where ever you are and whoever you are.
