Hi all, hope everyone is having a great day at work, home or where ever you are. Just the other day was having a serious discussion with a friend about retirement and about the activities and lifestyle we would have after retirement. The list was practically endless. However, we were unable to answer an essential question:

 **DO WE HAVE ENOUGH MONEY TO SPEND AFTER RETIREMENT?**

Given the present rising costs of living including the educational and other expenses, will we save just enough to get by? Have enough to fulfill our wishes? That is where the retirement corpus comes to the rescue

Please read the below article and let me know your thoughts:

  <b>Assessment:</b>
</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">
  When planning for retirement corpus, you should be aware of the all the expenses that you might incur once the salary stops. The planning should also include the factor of age expectation. As modern technologies have evolved, the longevity of life is increased, hence estimating your age is an essential factor. A study shows that an average human has a lifespan of 80 years.
</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">
  Then the process of accessing your expenses begins where you estimate on a monthly basis the amount you need after retirement by comparing the amount spent by you for monthly living expenses while in employment.
</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">
  While assessing you need to ask yourself certain questions that will help you set a budget for the retirement plan:

<p class="MsoNormal">
  <b>Budgeting:</b>
</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">
  Once the phase of assessing is over, the budgeting process starts where you need to set aside a specific amount for the retirement needs from your monthly salary. Preparing a budget helps you restrict your unwanted expenses and divert that portion into your retirement savings.  You can also downsize your debt by diverting the additional income. This action will reduce your financial commitments after retirement.
</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">
  <b>Investing:</b>
</p>

  There are many investments in the market that help you achieve your retirement corpus. You start by investing in mutual fund schemes, PPF scheme, and many others to increase your investment portfolio for retirement. Once the asset allocation and investment strategy are in place, all you need to do is invest.
