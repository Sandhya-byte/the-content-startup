> Sheryl Sandberg,  of Facebook says ‘No industry or country can reach its full potential until women reach their full potential. This is especially true of science and technology, where women with a surplus of talent still face a deficit of opportunity’.

Hello everyone, the curtain-call for 2018 has commenced, and 2019 is on its wake. My last post was about Blockchain basics and my understanding of the subject. I had also mentioned that I would be experimenting on a different topic like why coding seems to be unexplored territory for girls. So here we go,

Time and time again we hear the news that Tech industry has been booming and there are a ton of opportunities waiting for graduates passing out that year, the year before or still in the process of graduating. Anywhere in the world, you pick the women in the tech sector are not more than 30%. Why seems to be the big question?

Even though there are women present in the field of STEM.

STEM is the acronym of Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics as it is a known fact we girls are brainy than boys. (Want proof? Check 10th and 12th standard scores; many guys will pour their heart out)

Anyways back to the point, I found a bunch of unbelievable and infuriating reasons as to why coding and girls are like oil and water. My sources are a lot of studies published by those many universities worldwide including Stanford.

A while back, a Google engineer Jamee Damore wrote a ten-page-long memo saying that the biology of women does not allow them to be effective in the tech industry. He was fired subsequently, and now he is suing the company calling it conservative, and it is his added sin that he is a “**male**”(I don’t exactly understand as to when did the women become an alien species). So that&#8217;s that.

Now to the reasons, Stanford sociology graduate student Alison Wynn and professor Shelley Correll attended 84 campus recruiting incidents that left them very depressed.

**Point 1:**

Students were invited by a woman handing out raffle tickets whereas the men are gearing up for presentations and they were referred to as the lovely ladies or by making fun of them. (rude much!)

**Point 2:**

Men know to speak, and women don&#8217;t (seriously). Even though companies did send female programmers, their co-workers repeatedly cut them off even sometimes by raising their hand

**Point 3:**

They need to forget work-life balance. As women are natural nurturers, we draw the line when it comes to kids and homework. But, apparently, men don&#8217;t know as for them there is no difference as it home  they are front of the TV and in the office with the laptop(do we really need a reminder? we know that what happens, only the place differs)

**Point 4:**

As start-ups are now the rising breed, they don&#8217;t want to organise, they want to win and then arrange, so profanity among other things are encouraged prompting women to leave the job even though they are good.

From subtle body movements, patronising tones and brutal ignoring, men are literally behaving like high-school bullies and are snatching away the lollipops( come on guys, go get your own. It is getting old)

Even though some companies took the initiative of saying family first, meant work-life balance and diversity training, still women are very less and are inclining towards other professions. The most disappointing feature is that a company serious enough to recruit driven employees has still not recognised the potential of women employees.

Hope at least the year 2019 will witness a revolution in the tech industry with many more women joining the ranks in the tech industry. But to achieve this outcome, companies need to introduce flexible working arrangements, appoint women in leadership roles. At the same time, parents and teachers should encourage boys and girls at an early stage to learn the subject where they display a natural affliction.

All said and done, I wish you all a very happy and wonderful new year. May you have a splendid and amazing new year and my singature farewell

As usual, Namaste, Au Revoir, Sayonara and a simple Vanakkam to my readers out there where ever you are and whoever you are.
