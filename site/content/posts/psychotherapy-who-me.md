Hey everyone, I hope all are having a blast as the year 2020 has begun. I have been on a professional spin, these past few months and let's just say, I am on a roll baby!!!!

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"textColor":"black"} -->

But you know what , I am also doing my masters in Psychotherapy and Counseling. I am pretty excited to learn more about the devilish yet mysterious human mind.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"textColor":"black"} -->

So, first things first, I had told you all a while back that I will be unveiling my new site "TheContentStartup.com." But as luck would have it or my sheer laziness would have it, I am still a little bit stuck on the unveiling part. I am planning to make it live by mid-January, hopefully I get there!!!

Now, onto the topic,

## What is Psychotherapy?

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"textColor":"black"} -->

Well, Psychotherapy is often dubbed as "Talk Therapy" where we keep talking and prodding our clients to let go of their feelings, emotional disturbances and so on.

For instance, a person who is stressed out to the max or has undergone a trauma, can enlist the help of a psychotherapist. Basically, we get to help a person to recover through communication.

Usually, Psychotherapy is coupled with medications or some other kind therapies.

### **What is the difference between psychotherapist,**psychiatrist **and psychologist?**

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Well, while the similarities between these two terms and fields do overlap but the differences are quite subtle yet noticeable. Both psychotherapists and psychologists deal with complexities of the mind. A psychologist studies how a person thinks, feels and behaves from a scientific point of view and use those findings to single out abnormalities or figure out how the human mind works. More or less in the same manner, a psychotherapist uses variety of testing methods and techniques to counsel a person seeking to let go of their past trauma or looking for support to get back on their feet.

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

There is also another term called the Psychiatrist, a person who has clinical training along with four years of residency in Psychology. Psychiatrists are trained to deal with the problems arising physically and mentally. And, they are the ones who are authorized to prescribe medicines to patients.

One of the interesting things about all these terms is that there is a vow of complete secrecy that applies to every title starting with psy. So, whatever, you disclose with them stays confidential.

Now that I have given an intro, shall we move on to the main topic!!!!

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

## Psychotherapy- Who me??????????

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

For those who know me personally or through any of the networking sites, know very well I am a pakka chatterbox who has no filter. I have never been a person who could deeply think things through or have a calm and serene persona. I anger easily and also very sensitive by nature. I take things too personally and never think things thorough.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

I keep laughing at things so that I don't tell everyone how sad or hurt I am on the inside, because saying that out is of no use. This was my general perception before.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Then in the course of my freelancing, I happened to meet many people especially doctors who cleared my misconception. I came to understand not know (because I already knew, but didn't want to accept) that brushing off an issue is never the solution. You need to confront it, accept your feelings about it and find an amicable solution to get past the trauma.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Incidentally not many of us do that, we suppress our feelings and one day it bursts like a dam volcano. Most often, it becomes a suppressed rage that becomes a negative energy. The negative energy starts affecting us first and then the people around us. No amount of money or luxury will keep you happy. I was also slowly becoming a prey to that energy unknowingly.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

That's when I came to know about psychotherapy and I enrolled in the course along with my colleagues. It has been well over 6 months, but I am yet to touch the books.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

And I have also got the assignment topics to write on and I am just sheer lazy to get on to it. So, in the coming few weeks, you will be reading more of the psychotherapy topics in my blog. That is the only way I will study, so bear with me for a while.

Hope everyone has great day every day of their lives. Till then, it is time for my signature goodbye
