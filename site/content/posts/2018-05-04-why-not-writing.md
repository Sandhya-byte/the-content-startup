The age of writing is as old as civilization itself. Early men have expressed themselves by way of carvings in caves. As the civilization has progressed, so have we and our writing techniques. It has allowed us to pen our thoughts without a block. We can jot down our thoughts, tips, to-do lists and many more.

Writing gives a satisfaction of priority. It encourages the flow of ideas. It is also very malleable. It takes many forms of information, question, poetry and so on. It also stands as a testament to facts. A document in writing is much more strong evidence than words.

Now writing is slowly becoming obsolete, we are more engrossed in typing than penmanship.
