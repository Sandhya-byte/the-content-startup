Hey everyone, hope all are having a blast during this lockdown (I know it is boring, I can hear you🙄). We have been learning premium courses that are now free due to this pandemic. 😁🤩



I have been learning Ahrefs Blogging for Business, along with Content Marketing, Psychotherapy, and my assignments.

Sounds exhausting 😫, right? Trust me, it is more than that, But given the time, I somehow juggling all and benefitting it out of them as well.🤩😁

Last post, I had written about the field of smart contracts and its impact in various areas, especially Fintech.

Today, I am detailing that premise a bit further by explaining **how do smart contracts work**?

So, for people who are new to my site, here is [the link to the previous article](https://www.thecontentstartup.com/smart-contracts-make-it-all-work-together/)

Wait a minute, I could totally explain that through a metaphor

Ok, so let us assume you are looking to sell your house, and what is the next step in that process?

We list the home in all possible real estate sites and sit tight for buyers to come in. Once the buyer is finalized, the next step is to draw out a sale agreement.

For this we need to find a lawyer to get a legal opinion and all that shebang, meaning you will be buried in paperwork😥😥😥

But a smart contract renders everything obsolete, it is an automated process that churns out the agreement and related legal obligations without the need for middlemen🤗🤗

It not only gives you the lease documents but monitors many other things as well.

Intrigued?

Read on to know **how do smart contracts work**?🤔🤔🤔🤔

By the way, real estate example is one of the many verticals where smart contracts come handy.



In reality, Smart contracts help you in exchanging or transferring articles of value without the need for middlemen. They also have protocols in place to enforce those contracts

The easy way to make you understand is by comparing smart contracts to a vending machine.

We now often encounter them at metro stations, malls, and airports.

All you need to do in add the coins/notes to the slot and punch the number of the snack you want

The next thing you know, the snack is there for you to enjoy.😋😋😋😋

In a manner, smart contracts operate in the same way.

So, coming back to the real estate example, once you and your buyer have reached a consensus regarding the price

You need to go to a computer, not a human (Remember that) as smart contracts are one of the most efficient applications of Blockchain technology. You can read about [Blockchain](https://www.thecontentstartup.com/blockchain-an-introduction/) here as well

Moving on,

A smart contract is actually a bunch of code between two or more parties. They run on Blockchain and also have some pre-defined rules mutually agreed by the parties involved.

So, if the contract will get executed if and only if the obligations are met by all the parties involved.

Meaning the code will verify, facilitate, and enforce the conditions. It reduces the risk of fraud or bypassing the terms of the agreement.

As now almost all the transactions happen in the digital space, the code will help in protecting your asset or bank balance.

To sum it up, it is safe to say that your money and asset ownership will remain safe unless the conditions are satisfied.

This is called the “If-Then” principle 🙄🙄🙄🙄

Jokes apart, Smart contracts come with the potential of tracking real-time status and also save costs

Other than this significant advantage, Smart contracts come with many other benefits like:

Hope you understood **how do smart contracts work** and how they benefit us in the long run. Until next time, it is time for my signature goodbye.

***Stay Safe and Stay home and keep pushing yourself to be better always!!!!***
