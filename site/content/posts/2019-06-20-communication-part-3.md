Hello everyone, I am back with another post of my communication perfecting techniques, and I have just one advice:

# **Just Listen and then voice your thoughts**

When you listen to the opposite person without interrupting their flow, you will learn great many things.

This action will also make you look good. It instills the thought that you value the opposite person&#8217;s opinion and relationship.

I know that you will feel an urge to stress your point, but suppress it. Many a time, we can learn valuable lessons if we just listen.



As the saying goes, practice makes perfect, start listening to yourself and keep five minutes of your day as your time. This will help you recollect

1.  What have you done?
2. What could you have done better?
3. What is the gameplan for the next day?

Answer these questions and get back to your routine. Then pay attention to your loved ones and listen. Implement this practice with whomever you meet. I guarantee you will start finding a difference in your life.

That being said, it is time for my signature goodbye until I meet you back with a new post.

Namaste, Au Revoir, Sayonara and a simple Vanakkam to my readers out there where ever you are and whoever you are.
