  Hello everyone, it has been a while, since I had touched my blog. Even though, I kept promising myself that I would get back to my writing, the focus word being &#8220;Mine&#8221;, I just couldn&#8217;t. Still Wondering why?????????
</p>

<p class="has-text-color has-black-color">
  So, on to the topic, I have been exploring the area of Io T (Internet of Things) in my previous posts. You can find them here: <a href="https://sandhyasthoughtsblog.wordpress.com/2019/07/27/digital-footprints/">Digital footprints</a> and <a href="https://sandhyasthoughtsblog.wordpress.com/2019/08/06/digital-footprints-part-2/">Digital Footprints Part 2</a>. Today, I will be writing about the impact of this tech in the fin tech universe.

  As we all know and are experiencing , the advent of fin tech has cut the long queues of standing for hours in bank. We have stopped planning our whole day on the basis of when we will get access to our own hard-earned money and so on. All we now require is a smartphone and the banker is just a click away.
</p>

<p class="has-text-color has-drop-cap has-black-color">
  We effect a transfer to any part of the country or the world in seconds or minutes max. With the liberalization and easing of banking norms, visiting bank has now become a school trip to a museum. If someone says they are going to a bank, we start questioning them as though they are an amnesia patient.

<p class="has-text-color has-black-color">
  That being said, I now come to the impact of Io T in this rapidly developing sector. Before that, let me give you a short intro of Io T. It is a tech where you can track the movement of inanimate objects. Io T also lets those objects communicate with each other without the need of human meddling.
</p>

<p class="has-text-color has-black-color">
  In Fin tech, Io T is expected to bring about a revolution and change the way of the banking ecosystem structure. Some of the best advantages of this tech is that it gives valuable insights on the user&#8217;s preferences and behavior. It helps in sourcing in valuable data that keeps the workflow running smooth.
</p>

<p class="has-text-color has-black-color">
  As fin tech involves the play of world currencies, stocks, bonds and other financial items, Io T helps in tracking them. This makes better risk management and decision making a well-added bonus.
</p>

<p class="has-text-color has-black-color">
  Improved security is also the result of Io T. Actually, Citi Bank was one of the first financial institutions to adopt Beacons , a Bluetooth enabled app in smartphones, that allowed their customers to access the ATM lobbies in a single tap, without the need of swiping their ATM cards.
</p>

<p class="has-text-color has-black-color">
  In fact those beacons are now to be used in a way, that bank employee is alerted as soon as the customer sets foot in the bank. They can go directly to their assigned officer and get the job done. Io T will aid in making the banking operations far more easier and transparent.
</p>

<p class="has-text-color has-drop-cap has-black-color">
  In summation, It is safe to say, that many fin tech companies and start-ups are now exploring the potential of this technology. They aim to leverage it in a manner, that benefits the end user, be it corporate clients or individual ones.
</p>

<p class="has-text-color has-black-color">
  That&#8217;s all folks, this post concludes my Io T exploration. For the next topic, I am still looking around for Ideas and suggestions are most welcome. Please do leave a comment. Until then, it is time for my signature goodbye.
