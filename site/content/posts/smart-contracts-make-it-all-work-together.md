Hi everyone, hope all are doing good and staying safe during these trying times. While the general scenario is that most of us are working from home, we also have been given a golden opportunity to bond.\
\
As you all know, I just made my new site official after quite a long time, and now I am back with my new post. As usual, it is about fintech, which I seem to fancy a lot even though the terms sometimes do baffle me.

So, I bring you a yet another facet of Fintech’s emerging trend, Smart Contracts.

## So, What is a Smart Contract?

Well, in layman terms, we all know that a contract is a legally binding agreement between parties that collaborate together.Usually, we have a lawyer, two parties along with a witness or couple of witnesses to see the deal through.

Meaning there will be too much involvement, sometimes even a misunderstanding might occur between the parties. Then there is the trouble and costs of monitoring the parties, enforcing the clause in case of default. If nothing works in any one party’s favor, then resorting to legal action and compensation comes into the picture. To avoid all this, a Smart Contract comes into play

**Smart Contracts are all about making it work together**

Smart Contracts apply a completely different manner of approaching the world of contracts. They enforce trust between parties through a digitalized way that makes any financial transaction safe and secure. Moreover, the contract can be invoked at any point or place where it is applicable.\
And this becomes all possible because of the significant advances in the field of Fintech.

**Fintech is an engine driving the possibility of chances.**

With smart contracts, the parties will sign the contract with the help of cryptographic keys as a form of their digital signature. Meaning, you don’t need stacks of paper, Go Green guys.

Instead, they will use computer language as a form of encoding the contracts. These codes can never be tampered with and are highly safe. They are executed to be precise, accurate, and predictable.

When it comes to witnesses in smart contracts, it is the computers who are the first witness. So, it is a tough nut that can’t be cracked, you can neither bypass or surpass. The role of a public blockchain is to ensure the contract’s completion and execution by meeting every stipulation.

So, in a nutshell, there is no need for a physical contract, it speeds up transactions, and connects players from every part of the world.

## What is the importance of Smart Contracts in the fintech world?

Standardization code and the execution will bring down the cost of agreement and negotiations. Security is an added benefit as the transactions are encrypted and stored in an immutable way. Automated process ensures economy and speed as it reduces the time taken for a deal and avoids manual process time.

Counterparty risks can be avoided with smart contracts, and also settlement risks are not to be afraid of with smart contracts. Innovation is another crucial aspect, as this leads to many new business models and foster products.

Smart contracts have the power and reach to go beyond the boundaries and borders of nations, which makes them accessible to anyone virtually.

Fintech is destined to regulate and revolutionize the financial sector in many aspects. Starting from improving payment gateways with the increase to providing with the credits. E-commerce gets a great boost with Fintech as it makes account setup easier and no buzz and fuzz in transactions.

**Transactions made simple with Fintech.**
