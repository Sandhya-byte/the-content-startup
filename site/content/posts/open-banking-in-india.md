Hello everyone, it has been quite long since I interacted with you all!!!! 😀😀😀

I hope you guys are great and have adapted to the new normal. Unlock 1.0 is witnessing the opening of offices at minimal capacity (waiting for my office to open)👩‍💻👩‍💻👩‍💻

So, diving straight to the point, long long ago, so long ago, I had written a post on Open Banking. It is was more of a general idea of the field.

For the uninitiated, here is a small intro:

Open banking is a tech jargon that is synonymous with Fintech, and many startups today, are looking to leverage this platform.

We know that banking is a concoction of services of loan, debit, credit, net banking, and so on……

The process of these services often remain a mystery to many, but Open Banking has opened this secret process

Open banking is where your financial data is shared with financial institutions and fin tech companies to offer customized services.

**So, what else are the benefits of this Open Banking?**

* Well, the customer receives a customized user experience based on their spending patterns, purchasing behaviors, repayment history and so on. In a nutshell, they make you feel unique.
* Overheads are reduced to a great extent as it is a pain to go through the accounting and recon process.
* The customer has the freedom to choose the service provider of their choice. They get to make informed decisions about their financial health.
* Greater digital agility and acceleration when it comes to online banking services.🤳🤳

**Now that you have got a perspective of Open Banking, read on to know how it works in India:**

In my earlier post on [Open Banking](https://www.thecontentstartup.com/open-banking-what-is-it/), I had told you that APIs are used to fetch and manage user financial data. They are the bridge between banks and other third party providers.

So, right now, the UPI or Unified Payment Interface is the one that has adopted the approach, with some limitations. But one of the earliest adopters of UPI was YES Bank, who launched API banking services to digitize the B2B sector. Then many banks like ICICI, RBL Bank, Kotak Mahindra and so many others have taken up this approach.

They integrate with the ERP systems, perform e-KYC, PAN verification, offer lending and payment solutions, create innovative products by collaborating with third-parties and so much more.

But, many banks are now slowly exploring this field and we have many more miles to go due to intense regulatory limitations.

We still have hope and opportunities to turn the tables in the right way to reap the benefits of this open banking system. India is a land of creative business and diversified user behavior due to cultural differences.

It takes an innovative approach to establish Open banking in India without breaking any financial regulations.Maybe a little bend?

What is your thought on bringing such a system into India?🤔🤔

Do let me know!!! And follow my hashtag **\#sandhyasays** on LinkedIn to know more about Fintech.

My next article will explore the advent of Open Banking in Europe and its current scenario and reach.

Now it is time for my signature sign-off

Namaste, Au Revoir, Sayonara, and a simple Vanakkam to my readers out there where ever you are and whoever you are.🙋‍♀️🙋‍♀️🙋‍♀️

**Disclaimer: Open Banking is an entity that is governed by specific regions and regulations applicable to that region. It differs from country to country.**
