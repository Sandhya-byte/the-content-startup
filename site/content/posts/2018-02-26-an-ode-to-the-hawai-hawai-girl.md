The whole of India and its cine industry has lost its stalwart actress, Sridevi.  She was a role model to many of the girls and women across the country.  The Hawai-Hawai girl of the mid 90&#8217;s captured the heart of millions of fans. She started her career as a child artiste in Tamil films and then went on to act in all the major cine fields of the industry.

Sridevi has always fascinated me from my childhood days, and her expressive eyes garnered the attention of many fans. I grew up watching her films and imitating her in the mirror(without any witnesses around). Her movie &#8220;Meendum Kokila&#8221; showcased her as a timid housewife who becomes a crusader in bringing her husband back from his infatuations proving that if a woman makes a decision she can do anything. She also was a Padma Shree awardee for her contributions to the world of cine industry.  She was often spotted in beautiful sarees that drove the media into a frenzy. There are many instances where women will throng from one saree shop to another only to buy the same type of saree worn by Sridevi in their favorite films.

She often played women-centric roles, the movie English-Vinglish depicted a typical housewife&#8217;s transformation and how she surprises her husband and kids who think she is incapable of anything just because she has no knowledge of English.That particular movie inspired millions of housewives across the country to explore their other side. She was the small town girl who made it big in Tinseltown.

She played the role of timid housewife, a village belle or a revengeful mom who wanted justice for her daughter effortlessly and with the raw emotions of that character which made the audience feel her emotions and relate to the characters very easily.

I still remember the time where I watched the movie Mr. India three times just to see her dance the Hawai-Hawai song.  The famous song of surmayi akiyan re or the Tamil version Kanney Kalaimanne song is a favorite song still today. Her expressions of an amnesia patient or as a child was so realistic that it even brought tears to the most critique of the cinema effect.

It is shocking and devastating to hear that we have lost a charismatic person very early. May her soul rest in peace.

Please feel free to post your favorite songs or movies of this brilliant actress who broke the mold and proved that a woman can do anything.
