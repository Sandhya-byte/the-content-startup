  Hello all, a while back I had given a short intro on Io T and <a href="https://sandhyasthoughtsblog.wordpress.com/2019/07/27/digital-footprints/">click here to read the blog.</a> Today I will be writing in detail my understanding of the tech. I am sure many of you would have seen movies where the house responds to the owner&#8217;s command in a blink of an eye. Preparing the coffee, narrating the news, movement sensitive lights and so on
</p>

<p class="has-text-color has-black-color">
  This action is now possible with Io T. Io T is often referred to as Io E (Internet of Everything)
</p>

### So, how Io T works?

<p class="has-text-color has-black-color">
  Io T is a collection of web enabled devices that collects, send and acts on the data acquired by it as and when it receives the information. These devices collects these information through sensors and other hardware and guess what they can talk with other machines as well.
</p>

<p class="has-text-color has-black-color">
  For example, Like casting music from your phone to the TV, more or less in that manner.

<p class="has-text-color has-black-color">
  These devices are connected through internet and generate massive amounts of traffic. The communication happening between them are called M2M communication. (Machine to Machine communication).
</p>

<p class="has-text-color has-black-color">
  However, one hitch that we experience in Io T, is the usage of data. It mines large amounts of data that can be also used for other purposes. It does increase some serious privacy and security concerns.
</p>

<p class="has-text-color has-black-color">
  That being said, one of the huge advantage of Io T is that it transmits data in real time. Meaning we can keep our family safe in our absence, businesses can improve productivity and so on. Io T implications are not limited only to these areas, its scope is much more than that. From regulating traffic to national security, Io T&#8217;s potential is in its exploration and implementation stage..

<p class="has-text-color has-drop-cap has-black-color">
  There are four fundamental components of every Io T system:
</p>

  * **Sensors- That collect info in real-time**
  * **Connectivity &#8211; That data collected is stored and accessed through Cloud**
  * **Data Processing- The system works based on the data to implement the course of action.**
  * **User -Interface- While Io T is a standalone function, it does provide the results for human contemplation and decision making.** 

<p class="has-text-color has-black-color">
  This is it for now, next in the series will the impact of Io T in the Fintech sector. See you all soon. Until then it is, well you know
