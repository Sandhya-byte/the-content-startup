Hello everyone, Hope I am finding you all in high spirits, and you all are busy upskilling or outrunning yourselves. 😁😁😁

This week, I bring you guys the next topic that has captured my attention, Open banking. It has been quite rampant in the European continent, and the UK was the first country to adopt these measures followed by Australia, Canada, Japan, and so on.

Open Banking is now also the term we often hear associated with any Fintech startups or even from traditional players in the financial ecosystem.

In the earlier days or to be more specific in the 20th and early times of the 21st century, whenever we availed any financial product from the bank or an NBFC, do you remember how we used to repay?

You might think where this unrelated question popped up? 🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔

But there is a reason behind this,

Our usual methods were:

1. Assigning the task of repayment to a retired person typically it was the grandfather’s duty.
2. Paying it by check or cash.
3. Then came the novelty of paying it through ECS (Electronic Clearing System) 

Now back to the present, how do we do it now???

We do it via net or mobile banking or any other app like CRED and so on. We have the option to integrate Google PAY, Paytm, and so on because they remind us to make the payment along with some great offers from our favorite shopping store (shopping, sounds like a relic of the past). 👩‍💻👩‍💻

Now how does that happen?

Because they have access to your financial data and spending patterns

If your question is How? here is the answer,

Remember the "I agree" option whenever we install a payment app, that's how

This is just a glimpse of open banking where Third-Party Providers (TPPs) like Google Pay, Paytm, CRED, and so on have direct access to your secure financial data. However, both banks and TPPs have to adhere to stringent norms while accessing sensitive data.

They make use of this data to provide a personalized banking experience.

Like a better definition? Well, here it is🤓🤓

Open Banking is the agreement between a bank and customer to share the latter’s financial information with TPPs in a secure electronic manner. The Application Programming Interfaces or APIs (They are pieces of code) allows TPPs to access financial data that will be useful in designing apps and services.

In a nutshell, Open Banking aims to offer the best user experience. For example, reduced loan processing, easy switch of loan or bank accounts, finding credit cards with a lower interest rate, and so on.

Tidbit: Open Banking is also known as PSD2 (Second Payment Services Directive)

Open Banking acts as a motivational point for designing new fintech products. It holds the key to data insights currently revolutionizing the banking industry.

So, as a banking customer, what is your benefit?

You can expect more apps that make your repayments schedules, spending, investing and so on a breeze. Along with Artificial Intelligence and Big Data, APIs can predict better products suited to your spending habits.

You will get easier access to instant loans both first time and refinance. Even today, we get messages saying that we are pre-approved for a home loan, personal loan, and so on. (Nowadays not so much!!!!!)😏😏😏

When applying for credit with different lenders, you don’t need to go through the cumbersome process of submitting your documents again. Actually, that is how it works with credit score, all they need is your personal info, and they can pull your score. It will work the same way with documents.

You can pay by any method you chose to pay with, not only the normal banking channels.

While these are the benefits, there are some huge potential risks too. Well, that is a question for another day.

So, here is my signature goodbye

Oh forgot, to tell you guys something,

I am now using my hashtag **\#sandhyasays** on LinkedIn. So, follow it to stay in the loop. Hoping to hear from you all soon.

**Stay Safe and Stay home and keep pushing yourself to be better always!!!!**

As usual, Namaste, Au Revoir, Sayonara, and a simple Vanakkam to my readers out there where ever you are and whoever you are.
