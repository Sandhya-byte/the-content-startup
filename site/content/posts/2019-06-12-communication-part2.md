Hello everyone, hope all are in high spirits and good health. Last week, I had written about communication and why I needed it very badly. I had promised you guys that I will be sharing some tips and tricks that help in shaping your communication skill quite well.

For uninitiated, [click here for the previous post][1]

Here is a small recap as well:

I am by nature a fast talker and love to get my point across. But I had failed to understand that my point is not giving the effect I intended.

So, I turned to my ever trusty google to help learn more about the techniques that will help me talk slow and clearly (make my in-laws understand me, finally)

And I got mesmerised by these easy tips and I am sharing these tips with you today.

## #1 Adding a pause:

This might seem like a parlor trick, but it is very helpful. Pausing has never been my strong suit, hence the nickname. But it is quite helpful and has helped me in my corporate trainer journey as well.

Here is how you do it:

Stand before the mirror or be in a place where you have minimal or no disturbance. Use the timer app to time your words.

Add a pause between every five words.

Before that, write down what you are going to talk. It might seem very difficult at first, but it becomes an easy process as you keep practising.

Then start talking by enunciating each word clearly and internally count 1 to 5.

Pause

Then repeat this process over and over till you master it.

It also comes with an advantage of you being aware of the word you use. Meaning you start becoming better at handling situations.

Next, comes the important tip that is need of the hour as well.

Nowadays our biggest critics are our kids. They are worse than our parents and in-laws in finding our faults and we cannot hide from them, no matter what.

Converse with your kids daily about a subject, not related to studies, school or discipline. This will help you in slowing down your talking process. You will also start searching for words that help your kids improve their language as well.

## #2 Record yourself:

This tip will also help you communicate effectively.

Record your speech for five minutes every day in your phone&#8217;s recording app.

Play it back and note down the problems you are able to identify.

Then start listing those problems and pick the most difficult one to master.

If you are a problem is stammering and speed, enunciate each and every word clearly with a pause.

If the problem is the repetition of words, try finding the synonym of the word and use them.

If your problem is only speed, then time yourself and add pauses.

## #3 Be confident

Confidence is the key to effective communication. Hold your head high and speak confidently. Mastering confidence might seem like a very difficult thing to do, but so is not the case. Don&#8217;t flunk around in case something doesn&#8217;t happen, it will happen better next time(I know it is easy to say, but trust me it does help)

Present your case in a clean and concise way without the fear of failure. Even if you fail, hold your head high and accept your failure in the most gracious way,

Being a sore loser will hinder your thought process and restrict you from opening to avenues of learning.

Sometimes, it migh<span style="color:var(--color-text);">t make grow as well, but it does not always happen.</span>

That being said, the next post would be about different kinds of conversationalists we find around us. Hope you all find these tips useful and shape your conversation to a well-rounded form.

See you guys next week! Till then, it is my signature goodbye

Namaste, Au Revoir, Sayonara and a simple Vanakkam to my readers out there where ever you are and whoever you are.
