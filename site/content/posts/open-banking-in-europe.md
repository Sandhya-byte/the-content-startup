And I was AWOL for a few weeks, so I am going to get you started with my usual opening of:

Hey guys, Here is yet another chapter of Open Banking and how it works in the European continent. I am sure you guys know that I have been writing about this subject for the past couple of weeks now. My last blog post explored [Open Banking in India](https://www.thecontentstartup.com/open-banking-in-india/), and now we are going to Europe to see how it works.

***Ps: Open Banking owes its origins to Europe especially the UK actually***

Now that is done, I am going to reintroduce myself,

Hi, I am [Sandhya](http://www.linkedin.com/in/sandhyamanikandan), a writer, and generalist with interest in everything and anything. I am pursuing my MSc. Psychotherapy and Counselling like my life is not already complicated enough. But the sweet mysteries of the human mind do make me so curious and any way that is a topic for another day.

So, now it is time to dive into the post……...

Open banking ranks as the second most favorite buzz-worthy topic among the tech enthusiasts and in business circles hailing from Europe.

And Open banking need not necessarily be a dull topic if you view it in an operational reality attitude

***"Open Banking is here to stay"-Benny Boye Johansen, Head of OpenAPI, Saxo Bank.***

In fact, an Open Banking forum held at Amsterdam explored the core context of implementing API-led Open Banking. The reach of this tech was so in detail that even an eCommerce store will use APIs for its operations. So it is not something that is only spoken about in tech events or used by Fintech companies.

Now that you get a pretty good picture of how Open Banking is famous in Europe, you also need to know about its foundation, and that is the PSD2.

Yeah, you have heard this term before, I had used it in my first blog about [Open Banking](https://www.thecontentstartup.com/open-banking-what-is-it/).

Thanks to Kishore, a dear friend of mine who gave a better clarity of what it actually is, and I am transferring the same below.

## PSD2 theory and its foundation (Drumroll please):

Since Open Banking revolves around money, rules and regulations are a must, meaning PSD2.

The PSD2 are second services payment directives, supplemented by the Technical Regulatory Standards.

It allowed the EU to bring innovation and competitive elements into the reality game. They did not target or treat it as an enhanced payment gateway but more like a secure way of customized bank experience to the end-user (consumer or startup business)

PSD2 paved a solid groundwork and allowed the fintech domain to go beyond the stars with their innovation.

Ah, one more thing, PSD2 and Open Banking have a subtle but distinctive difference. PSD2 is a regulation that directs banks to open their data to third parties. In contrast, Open banking does the same in the standardized format.

## Open Banking Status In Europe

Stripe, a popular payment gateway firm from California, created the disruptive chain by implementing a 7 line API code that enabled the users to make the payment within their app itself. After this, the entire big players from the US followed suit. This was inspired by Europe's revolution of Open Banking.

Now, again Europe is leading the pack by already creating its own Open Banking framework and it has been in existence from Jan 2018.

**Few sneak peeks into EU open banking operational models :**

* Payment Initiation Service Providers (PISPs)
* Account Information Service Providers (AISPs)
* Few non-bank payment initiations such as account information services, and personal finance management across multiple banks.

From Dec 2020, strong customer authentication will become mandatory for all kind of payments and transactions, (even for personal finances managements)

These are a few small sneak peeks from the EU framework. Still, they are the Alpha players of this game and making changes that nobody could even imagine.

## Banks who support Open Banking in Europe:

The high street banks are already operating with the Open Banking system for few API's and establishing an in-detail approach to the other customized services

* Royal Bank of Scotland Group (Natwest, Ulster Bank, and Royal Bank of Scotland)
* Santander
* Barclays Bank
* HSBC Group (HSBC, First Direct, M&S)
* Lloyds Group (Lloyds, Halifax and Bank of Scotland)
* Nationwide
* Danske Bank
* Bank of Ireland (including the Post Office)

These giants have created protocols to provide and support the fintech firms with the required data they are seeking with the user's permission. Few of them are given a deadline to operate with full customization before the end of 2020.

So, that's it guys this post concludes our Europe tour of Open Banking, and I am going to figure how to take this topic even further.

While I am at it, I am also planning to write a few topics of psychotherapy as I have not attempted them yet, even though the ideas are flowing.

Stay tuned and stay safe, happy and healthy

This is me signing off with my usual goodbye

Namaste, Au Revoir, Sayonara, and a simple Vanakkam to my readers out there where ever you are and whoever you are.
