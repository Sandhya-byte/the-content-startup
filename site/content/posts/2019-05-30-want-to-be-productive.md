Hello everyone, hope everyone had a fantastic holiday and are now getting ready for a new school year. We are back to square one frantically remembering long lost homework assignments and the last minute details. Anyhow, at the end of the day, we often end up feeling that we could have done a bit more, only if we have planned well!

In reality, so is not the case, we complete the work we deem important irrespective of our planning. So, that brings us to the paradox of what should be done to make us feel productive and satisfied? Trust me the answer to the last question is quite simple yet complex enough to drive us crazy.

It all boils down to the age-old saying of our elders, wake up early, then your mind will be fresh as asparagus. I have tried and right now implementing that practice and the results are noticeable. Nevertheless, being more productive also requires us to stay in a positive frame of mind(As if). So, let us start with these simple techniques that give us short-lived satisfaction of being productive (we constantly crave the bliss of being omniscient).

**The first technique:**

The reason we often fail to feel productive is due to the fact of setting up unreasonable goals. Never push your self to the limit of exertion, it messes up everything and you feel horrible.

**Second:**

Concentrate on one single task first( it is easy to say and harder to do, I know I can hear your thoughts!) I accept it is quite difficult at first, but you get used to it in time. Have a one-track mind when doing a job, this helps you in getting the best output.

**Third:**

Time yourself. Whenever, you take on a job to complete, be mindful of the time it takes to finish. This regular practice will help in shortening your tasks and completing them in shorter amounts of time. It helps you identify patterns of where you are slowing down or where is the danger zone.

**Fourth:**

Delegation and follow-up. Don&#8217;t put everything on your head(I do it all the time, hypocritical right? But, now I am letting go of the habit) I have stopped taking up tasks that are beyond my physical and mental capacity. I urge you to do the same.

**Fifth:**

Find the high-traffic areas. Wondering what I am talking about? Well, we always say &#8220;My god, mornings 8am-10am are the worst, getting everyone ready is such a challenge&#8221;. Figure out that particular time and chart your activities. Be proactive and prepare ahead of these traffic hours to plough through the situation in a calm and relaxed manner.

**Sixth:**

Declutter. Often, the reason for chaos is clutter. One of the main sources of irritation is when we are unable to find things we need at the nick of the time. Keeping things organized aids in peaceful mornings and a pleasant day. Instilling these values in kids right from an early age inculcates a sense of discipline in them.

**Seventh:**

Have some physical exercise as part of your daily regimen. It is not about staying fit or slim. Physical exercise increases your alertness and blood flow. You will be less anxious, more focused and less stressed.

**Eighth:**

Stop and reflect. Think about the things that happened throughout the day. It helps you to prioritize the work and what has to be changed. Reviewing your day helps in future planning and in optimizing your time.

Use these tips to be more productive and be happy at the same time. If you have some more points to add, do add them in the comments.

Until then, it is time for my signature goodbye:

Namaste, Au Revoir, Sayonara and a simple Vanakkam to my readers out there where ever you are and whoever you are.
