Hi everyone, welcome to the new year, which happened two weeks ago. I was planning to post from the start of the year, and it has happened just now. This action of mine lead me to a conclusion, planning occurs all along, but the execution of that plan is the thing matters. Are we really focusing on how to get there or we planning all along?

There are instances where we hear the long sigh of despair which are typically followed by these words&#8221; wish I dared to take the step or wish I had taken that leap that would have propelled my career or life.&#8221;

Now, more frequently am hearing these words from a lot of people, that being considerate of other needs had taken their time away from their needs. This happens more so in the case of mothers who have their life always around their kids and other familial responsibilities.

As a mother, I have and am going through this situation almost every day, and I have taken this decision of taking some time out for myself.

This solution not only applies to women but also to men who need a little time-out for themselves. So make a resolution for this year and take a little time-out for yourselves. After all, a resolution can be taken anytime right?
