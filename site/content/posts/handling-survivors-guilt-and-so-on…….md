Well, hey guys, just like I said many moons ago that I will be writing about some psychology topics in my last blog. Here is one for you ponder over the weekend, well don't be so surprised, I did give you guys a heads-up that will be sharing my Gyan of Psychology in the coming weeks.

So, getting into the topic, I was accosted by some of my friends, colleagues, acquaintances, and even passers-by while standing at a supermarket scrounging for last-minute dinner ideas. You know what was the repeated statement everywhere?

**"That we are lucky to be alive"** while I accept that is a profound statement with each word to its truest sense, but there was a hint of guilt at the end of the sentence.

And In case you are wondering why these many adverbs and adjectives in the above sentence, well, I was trying to convey the emotion. Carrying on, this is called the Survivor's guilt.

It is a common occurrence in a person who has survived through tragic accidents, undergone life-altering trauma, and so on.

But now I am witnessing a hint of it everywhere due to this pandemic where we are not only fighting for daily lives but the very essence of human survival (Drama, I know)

Survivor's guilt happens when you feel bad for surviving a mental or physical trauma when others did not. While it is absolutely no fault of yours, you still end up feeling guilty.

The symptoms of anxiety, headaches, and some may even go through sleeplessness while battling this guilt.

**One more thing!!! Survivor's guilt is also a recognized symptom of PTSD, and the one I am talking about here is the generic version, not of any mental health condition.**

Now that I have established the guideline let me move on the crux of the topic, I am going on about:

Handling this guilt is of paramount importance because it not only crumbles your self-esteem but also affects your personality. It may make you go from a happy person to a moody person, just because you feel you can't be happy as you are scared of what others may think.

You can't be happy because you might think that you are doing a gross injustice to the ones around you and so on. Then the usual happenings of low productivity strained relationships, and all take place.

**Now, coming to the ways of tackling this guilt:**

First, we can start by acknowledging that yes, we are feeling a teeny tiny bit guilty of surviving and still surviving through this pandemic. ( which is no fault of ours)

Never try to repress them, you will end up harming yourself.

Once you have them out in the open, it is time to redirect them into something positive.

You can celebrate every day of your life by taking at least five minutes for yourself to do something you love.\
\
I won't resort to the theatrics of celebrating every single second, because it will get bored after a while. Keep them coming in small doses so that you don't lose the joy of it.

Try channeling your energy into gratitude and give your best back to society. Remember, even a small act of kindness can make your day.

Stick to your daily routine and prioritize your work. Make exercise a part of it to refresh you both physically and mentally.

Create a signature habit that resonates deep within your soul (stopped with you, but added the word "soul" for extra effect")

Connect with people, be it neighbors, friends, or family, stay connected with them. Let out your feelings and discuss what you are going through. It is not a crime to say that I just can't do it today.

There is always help around, and it is given to those who seek it.

That being said, here comes my signature goodbye

Namaste, Au Revoir, Sayonara, and a simple Vanakkam to my readers out there where ever you are and whoever you are.
