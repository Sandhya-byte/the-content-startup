_**Hello to everyone out there! I&nbsp;am&nbsp;Sandhya. I am a homemaker with two kids. I have varied interests, and right now my interest is in content writing. I have a background in commerce, and I tried pursuing chartered accountancy, and currently, I am working to continue my company secretary course, and people the keyword is trying to do so will see how it turns out. Well back to what I was saying I am currently working as a content writer and I admit I like it. It is safe to say that I have gained a sound knowledge of it. Well other than that, it is same old Indian story of a married girl.**_

_**Bye bye, see you in my next post.**_
