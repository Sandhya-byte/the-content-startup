I am Sandhya Manikandan, a Psychotherapist, writer, marketer, communication specialist, mother, wife and daughter. I love writing about the Fintech industry and it is here to stay, so head on over to my blog if you would love to know about Fintech in small bytes. Too much information can also make your head reel, so to lighten the mood I will be writing about some psychology topics and any other interesting tid-bits that catch my attention, every now and then, do check out the MyRantings section. This is me and this is my lifestory, the chapters are yet to be written, just going with the flow of life. Welcome to my site, and I sincerely hope you like it.
